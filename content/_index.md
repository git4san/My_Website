        <div class="justified-text">
        My research is dedicated to advancing the security and privacy of critical systems using cutting-edge techniques. I design innovative tools and methodologies to detect and mitigate complex security threats, including zero-day vulnerabilities and application-specific logic flaws, particularly in software applications and critical infrastructure like Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). 

        **Contributions:**

        - **Pervasive Micro Information Flow Tracking (PerMIT):** A fine-grained solution to detect sophisticated security threats by monitoring and managing data flows at a micro level within applications.
        - **SQUIRREL Tool:** An advanced tool that enhances information flow tracking with source-level memory allocation event logging, providing deep insights into application behaviors and vulnerabilities at the code level.
        - **Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms:** Researching and developing comprehensive privacy solutions across the data lifecycle, utilizing cryptographic methods and differential privacy to ensure data security and regulatory compliance.
        - **Securing Communication Devices:** Investigating physical and software-based mechanisms to protect modern communication devices, addressing various vulnerabilities from hardware to software layers.
        - **Machine Learning (ML) Integration:** Leveraging ML for anomaly detection and predictive security, enabling automated identification and mitigation of threats with increased efficiency.
    
        **Focus Areas:**
        
        - **OT/ICS Security:** Strengthening the defenses of critical infrastructures like SCADA systems against evolving cyber threats, ensuring their safety and reliability.
        
        - **Data Privacy:** Developing and deploying privacy-preserving methods such as k-anonymity, differential privacy, and federated learning to secure sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.
        - **Fuzzing Techniques:** Innovating fuzzing approaches that combine AFL, symbolic, and concolic execution to uncover new software vulnerabilities, particularly those hidden in complex software systems.

        My work bridges theoretical advancements with practical implementation, contributing significantly to dependable system security, software security, and data privacy. By focusing on real-world applications, I aim to create impactful solutions that enhance the resilience and security of mission-critical systems.

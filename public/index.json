In this project, we delve into various privacy preservation mechanisms that can be implemented at different stages of the data lifecycle, from collection to deletion. These methods ensure that sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access, exploitation, or misuse. The project also explores foundational techniques like k-anonymity, and advanced methods such as differential privacy and cryptographic solutions.\nOverview of Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms Privacy preservation mechanisms are essential for protecting sensitive data across its entire lifecycle, including collection, storage, processing, transmission, and deletion. Here, we outline the core methods employed to maintain data confidentiality and integrity:\nData Masking: This technique hides specific elements of the data, ensuring sensitive parts (e.g., personal identifiers) are not exposed. Pseudonymization: Replaces identifiable information with pseudonyms to maintain the usefulness of data while protecting individuals\u0026#39; identities. Encryption: Ensures that data is only accessible to authorized users through cryptographic techniques, providing protection during storage and transmission. Randomized Response (RR): This technique should introduce randomness into responses during data collection to protect individuals’ privacy, typically used in surveys or sensitive inquiries. Advanced Privacy Preservation Methods Beyond the foundational techniques, there are more advanced privacy mechanisms to enhance protection, especially in the realm of machine learning and data processing. These methods include:\nDifferential Privacy (DP): DP introduce carefully calibrated noise to datasets to prevent the identification of individual data points while maintaining overall data utility. Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC): Enable multiple parties to compute a function over their inputs without revealing the inputs to each other. Federated Learning: This technique should enable model training on decentralized data, ensuring that sensitive data remains localized without being shared across systems. Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): A cryptographic method allowing one party to prove the validity of a statement without revealing the underlying data. Blockchain for Privacy: Distributed ledger technologies provide secure, transparent, and immutable records, ensuring data integrity and privacy, particularly for auditing and compliance purposes. Privacy at Different Stages of the Data Lifecycle Privacy preservation mechanisms can be applied at each stage of the data lifecycle to provide comprehensive protection.\nChallenges and Limitations of Privacy Preservation Despite significant advances in privacy-preserving technologies, there are still critical challenges to overcome. These include:\nBalancing Privacy and Data Utility: Many privacy techniques, especially those adding noise (like differential privacy), must find the right balance between protecting data and preserving its usefulness. Adversarial Attacks: Attackers may use inference attacks or adversarial machine learning to bypass privacy mechanisms and extract sensitive data. Scalability: Implement advanced cryptographic or decentralized techniques (e.g., MPC, federated learning) can be computationally intensive, making them difficult to scale for large datasets or complex applications. Regulatory Compliance: With evolving global regulations, organizations must continuously adapt their privacy mechanisms to meet standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and other regional laws. Real-World Use Cases Privacy preservation methods are used in various sectors, ranging from healthcare to finance. Here are a few notable examples:\nHealthcare: Hospitals use differential privacy to anonymize patient data while still enabling critical research. Secure multiparty computation is also used to allow collaborative medical research across institutions without sharing raw patient data. Financial Sector: Banks use encryption and secure sharing protocols to allow cross-border transactions without exposing sensitive financial details. Blockchain-based systems are gaining traction for secure and transparent auditing.

From smart homes to industrial systems, AI-enabled IoT devices are revolutionizing modern living and business operations. However, this rapid increase in interconnected devices brings serious security challenges. The scale, variety, and inherent vulnerabilities of IoT devices present significant risks, leading to one of the most urgent cybersecurity concerns today.\nProliferation of IoT Devices and AI Integration: AI has dramatically enhanced the capabilities of IoT devices, allowing them to perform complex tasks autonomously. This includes everything from voice-controlled assistants and smart thermostats to industrial robots and medical monitoring systems. However, the growing presence of AI in these devices increases their attack surface.\nAI-driven automation has enabled IoT devices to make real-time decisions without human intervention, exposing them to new vulnerabilities. In many cases, the rush to market IoT devices has led to insufficient security testing and updates. Security Risks in AI-Powered IoT Ecosystems: The integration of AI in IoT has introduced several complex security challenges, exacerbating traditional risks like data breaches and system hijacking. Security risks are heightened due to the large number of devices, lack of standardization, and weak encryption protocols.\nMany IoT devices have limited computational power, which restricts the implementation of robust encryption and security mechanisms. AI-driven devices generate vast amounts of data, making privacy breaches particularly dangerous. Compromised devices can lead to massive data leaks or unauthorized access to sensitive personal or corporate information. Real-World Threats and Consequences: The widespread adoption of IoT devices has resulted in an alarming number of security breaches. Incidents of hackers taking control of AI-powered devices, launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or exploiting weaknesses in smart systems have become increasingly common.\nThe infamous Mirai botnet attack leveraged insecure IoT devices to create one of the largest DDoS attacks in history. Weak security protocols in home security cameras, smart appliances, and healthcare devices have allowed attackers to spy on users, manipulate systems, and even cause physical harm. AI-Specific Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices: AI models integrated into IoT devices introduce their own vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit AI algorithms through adversarial inputs, causing devices to malfunction or make incorrect decisions. This type of threat could impact anything from autonomous vehicles to industrial machinery.\nAdversarial attacks on AI models can fool smart devices into behaving unpredictably, leading to potentially dangerous consequences. There is a growing concern over data poisoning, where attackers manipulate training data to weaken AI models embedded in IoT devices. Security Measures to Mitigate Risks: Edge Computing: Processing data locally on IoT devices rather than sending it to the cloud reduces latency and exposure to cyberattacks. Zero Trust Architecture: Implementing Zero Trust security protocols ensures that every IoT device is authenticated and verified before gaining access to the network. AI for Security: Using AI to monitor and detect unusual behaviors in IoT devices can enhance real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Firmware Updates and Patching: Ensuring regular security updates and patches for IoT devices to address known vulnerabilities. Encryption and Secure Communication: Implementing end-to-end encryption for all IoT device communications to prevent unauthorized access and tampering. As AI continues to drive the expansion of IoT, the associated security challenges become more pressing. Addressing these challenges with robust cybersecurity practices is critical to ensuring the safe integration of AI-powered IoT devices in homes, businesses, and industrial settings.\nRelated Topics: Internet of Things (IoT) Mirai Botnet Adversarial Attacks on AI Systems Some Papers to Explore: Automated Security Analysis for Real-World IoT Devices Made for Each Other: AI and IoT Adversarial Machine Learning and IoT Device Security All You Need to Know About On-Device ML Acquisitional Rule-based Engine for Discovering IoT Devices Generative Intrusion Detection on IoT Dataset ASecurity Risks Concerns of Generative AI in the IoT Machine Learning-Enabled IoT Security \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; ","date":1728000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728000000,"objectID":"01dc09f95b14f59e86775acd4092d7e6","permalink":"http://localhost:50549/project/surge-of-iot-devices/","publishdate":"2024-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/surge-of-iot-devices/","section":"project","summary":"Explosive growth of the IoT...","tags":["SPD"],"title":"Surge of IoT Devices by AI","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sanoop Mallissery","Kun-Yi Chiang","Chun-An Bau","Yu-Sung Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"Citation Sanoop Mallissery, Kun-Yi Chiang, Chun-An Bau, and Yu-Sung Wu, \u0026#34;Pervasive Micro Information Flow Tracking,\u0026#34; in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 4957-4975, Nov.-Dec. 2023, doi: 10.1109/TDSC.2023.3238547. @article{10023951, author={Mallissery, Sanoop and Chiang, Kun-Yi and Bau, Chun-An and Wu, Yu-Sung}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing}, title={Pervasive Micro Information Flow Tracking}, year={2023}, volume={20}, number={6}, pages={4957-4975}, keywords={Target tracking;Security;Codes;Malware;Source coding;Emulation;Anomaly detection;Anomaly detection;dynamic information flow tracking;online taint analysis;production system;zero-day attacks}, doi={10.1109/TDSC.2023.3238547} } Related material Presentation slides ","date":1721001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721001600,"objectID":"d6256de2940a3db5bc2f71995fa7f43d","permalink":"http://localhost:50549/publications/journal-article/permit-method/","publishdate":"2024-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/journal-article/permit-method/","section":"publications","summary":"This paper proposes Pervasive Micro Information Flow Tracking (PerMIT), a fine-grained approach for detecting complex security threats in software systems.
